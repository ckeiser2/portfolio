# Summary
The Project below was a python project doing a text analysis of president speeches. This involves associating a TF-IDF score and creating a data visualization as shown below. TF-IDF is measured by the following formula (*TF-IDF = term_frequency * inverse_document_frequency*) while the red dots on the graph below showcase "target words" in the analysis.
