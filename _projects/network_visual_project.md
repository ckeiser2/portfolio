*Python - Packages: Networkx, Bokeh*

# Description
For this project I did a text analysis in python using Networkx and Bokeh to make detailed models that show the relationships, factions and importance by occurence of the characters in "A Song of Ice and Fire (Book 1) of Game of Thrones. Below we will go into further detail on the analysis done. This was imported as an html as Ruby and Jekyll took away Bokeh's interactivity features when imported like an altair graph.

*Modularity* : Modularity is a measure of the structure of networks or graphs which measures the strength of division of a network into modules.

*Eigenvector* : Is the measure of a node's "influence" within a network
